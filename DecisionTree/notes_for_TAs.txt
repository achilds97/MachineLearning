Hey, just wanted to give a quick intro to my code to help you understand the code a bit better.

I'm not sure how you are grading this, but if you just want to create a tree on the cars dataset and the bank dataset
the relevant functions are create_cars_tree and create_bank_tree. These will print out results for each height of the
tree as well as each method of calculation.

If you want to create separate trees the method to create the tree is called id3 and requires a specifically formatted
dataset, attributes and labels. For a reference for this you can see the top of either the cars or bank method. The
dataset is the most complicated looking, but it is just a list of dictionaries with one dictionary for each row of the
dataset. The label column must be called 'label' also. There is additionally a value appended to each row that contains
the value for this row, so that you can do fractional items if needed. For example if you wanted to do the example row
in the homework you would add 5/14, 4/14 and 5/14 to the end of each row.

The rest of the functions have comments above them to help explain their purpose. Hopefully it all makes sense.

Thanks for grading!
